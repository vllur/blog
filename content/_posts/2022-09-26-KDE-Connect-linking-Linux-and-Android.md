---

Have you ever wanted to use your phone like a remote to steer your PC? Look no more. When your computer and phone is on the same Wi-Fi network all sorts of tricks are possible.

## Android installation

Download [KDE Connect](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/) app. You can get it from Google Play or F-Droid.

## Computer installation

If you are using KDE or something other than GNOME, install it like so:

```sh
sudo apt install kdeconnect
```

For GNOME, install [GSConnect](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1319/gsconnect/) extension.

## Pairing

To pair a device, first make sure that both are on the same Wi-Fi network. Using phone's tethering works too. On your phone, open KDE Connect, and select "Pair new device" from menu on the left. You should see your computer on the list. Click "Request pairing". Now your computer should receive notification about pairing request. Accept it, and you're done.

## Features

This is not a complete list, but you might like to:
- receive phone notifications
- send files to phone
- send SMS

on your PC, and use your phone to:
- pause and change volume of music playing on your computer
- use its screen as a touch pad
- send files to computer
- control presentations

and share clipboard between the two.
