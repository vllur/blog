If you used Gimp's filters, you probably wished it had more of them. And it does, you just need to install them separately. G'MIC is a popular and vast collection of great effects.

# Installation

Head to [gmic.eu/download](https://gmic.eu/download) and choose version for your system from "G'MIC-Qt plug-in" section. On Linux, extract plugin file from archive and put it in `plug-ins` within your Gimp directory. For example: `/home/vllur/.config/GIMP/2.10/plug-ins`.

# Usage

Now you can launch a new window by navigating to `Filters` and `G'MIC-Qt...`.
